### Dealing with Abstractions
- engineering econ models typically represent a project through estimates
of costs and benefits of project over time

### Modelling Process

![](Day1/modelling_process.PNG)

### Design Criteria
- function, cost, safety, sustainability

## Day 2 Jan 8, 2018

### What is Sustainability

- Linear Model
	- yields a lot of waste

	![](Day2/linear.PNG)

- Closed Loop Model
	- Nothing should be wasted

#### Global Goals
- Waste nothing
- adapt to the place
- use free resources
- optimize not maximize
- create livable environemtnt

#### Metrics and Tools
- life cycle cost analysis
- life cycle assessment
- ecological footprint analysis

#### Stakeholders
- should take end-user into consideration
- eg juice box design - one time use, flimsy straws

#### Ethics
- engineers have responsibility towards
	- client
	- profession
	- society

#### Complexity

#### Triple Bottom Line
- need to think about social sustainbaility
	- socially sound, acessible to users
- environmental sustainability
	- conserve earth's resources and raw material
- economic sustainability
	- used to be the main focus

### Case Study - Interface Carpets
- cut down ecologcal footprint by 1/3
- claims to be world's first sustainable corporation
- over 5 billion pounds of carpet now in landfills
- went from selling carpets to leasing carpets (floor covering services)
- Benefits
	- carpet tiles used so only worn out parts replaced
	- increases net employment
	- eliminates disruption
	- less glue fumes
	- incentive of keeping it in good condition '**_drive it like a rental_**
- invented new type of floor-covering called Solenium that can be remanufactured
- all worn materials can be completely separated
- in 10 years they saved $262 mill
- won $20M contract from U of California
- went from trucking to rail
- cut shipping cost by 50%
- inspired Wal-Mart to deploy sustainable practices
- 72% reduction in waste water

## Engineering Economics

### Time Value
- would rather get a million dollars today vs 10 years
	- due to inflation
	- money has earning power over time (investments)
	- time allows money to earn interest

### Interest
- **_compensaion for giving up the use of money_**
- **_difference between amount of money lent vs paid_**


	```future worth = present worth + interest```

	```F = P + I```
	- I = Lump sum interest
	- i = interest rate

#### Lump-Sum Interest Rate
- 

**There is a legal interest rate, you can't go over 60%**
- or you get charged with usury

#### Nominal Interest Rate
- Interest rate - rate of interest charged for use of money, usually expressed as annual rate
- interest period - base unit over time whihc an interst rate is quoted, usually 1 year
- interest rate specified for one year is a **_nominal interest rate_**
- same as annual percent rate (APR)

#### Simple Interest
- rate that doesn't change
- rarely used in practice
- I<sub>S</sub> = PiN
- ``` F = P + PiN```

#### Compound Interest
- results in a lot more money
