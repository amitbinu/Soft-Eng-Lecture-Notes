### What is a Control System
- simplest form - output provided for a given input
![](control_system.PNG)
- unity feedback - input 1 output 1

### Why Need?

- power amplification
- remote control
- convenience on input
- compensation for disturbances - i.e slope of ball, air, door opening
- improve system speed, accuracy, repeatability, performances

### System Configurations

#### Open-Loop System

![](open_loop_system.PNG)
- open loop control (cheap, not robust)
- no way of knowing if expected output is actual output

### Closed-Loop System

![](closed_loop_system.PNG)
- allows you to check output

### Transient and Steady-State Response

![](transient_steady_state_response.PNG)
_tansient = in transition_
- transient response tradeoff
	- if you get where you want really fast (high gain)
	- oscillates around point and doesn't settle
	![](high_gain.PNG)
	- low gain: doesn't overshoot
```	
overshoot = a/b * 100%
a = x-axis to highest point
b = x-axis to lowest point
```

### Stability

```
Total response = Natural response + Forced response
```

- Natural response (homogeneous) - evolution of system due to initial conditions
- Forced response (particular soln) - Evolution of system due to input
- bounded input doesn't create bounded output :dizzy_face:
- system has to be stable

## Day 2 Jan 5 2018

### Modelling in the Frequency Domain

- Laplace Transform
- do by hand and by matlab

#### Lab 1: Compensator Terminology

##### Proportional Control System 
- 70% of problems can be solved with PID
- calculating controlled output to make motor go proportionally faster
- open loop version: apply step voltage to motor
   - through feedback, you can put more energy into the system “cranking up the gain” enough so that it doesnt go unstable or star to oscillate
- makes things go faster

##### Integral Control System

- keep the motor moving in theory
- however, not always how it works in practicality therefore, a step voltage doesnt mean anything
- therefore you need to integrate over time so the voltage becomes big
- integral gain gets rid of steady state air  
- gets ready of steady state air

##### Derivative Control System
- prevents overshootir get desired amount of overshoot
- later we will leanr the theory to predict the control of systems
- in practice, requires a lot of tweeking and fine tuning 
- basically helps to reduce overshoot and improve performance of system

##### More on Lab 1 - underdamped response specifications

1. Rise time is the time for output to go from 10% (0.1Cfinal) to 90% (0.9Cfinal)
2. peak time - time required to reach first and largest peak
3. percent overshoot - %OS percentge that output overshoots final value
‘’’
((Cmax - Cfinal)/Cfinal)*100%
‘’’ 
4. settling time - is it close enough to do whatever we have to do (settles within plus or minus 2% of Cfinal
