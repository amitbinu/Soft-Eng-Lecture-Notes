### What is a Control System
- simplest form - output provided for a given input
![](control_system.PNG)
- unity feedback - input 1 output 1

### Why Need?

- power amplification
- remote control
- convenience on input
- compensation for disturbances - i.e slope of ball, air, door opening
- improve system speed, accuracy, repeatability, performances

### System Configurations

#### Open-Loop System

![](open_loop_system.PNG)
- open loop control (cheap, not robust)
- no way of knowing if expected output is actual output

### Closed-Loop System

![](closed_loop_system.PNG)
- allows you to check output

### Transient and Steady-State Response

![](transient_steady_state_response.PNG)
_tansient = in transition_
- transient response tradeoff
	- if you get where you want really fast (high gain)
	- oscillates around point and doesn't settle
	![](high_gain.PNG)
	- low gain: doesn't overshoot
```	
overshoot = a/b * 100%
a = x-axis to highest point
b = x-axis to lowest point
```

### Stability

```
Total response = Natural response + Forced response
```

- Natural response (homogeneous) - evolution of system due to initial conditions
- Forced response (particular soln) - Evolution of system due to input
- bounded input doesn't create bounded output :dizzy-face:
- system has to be stable
