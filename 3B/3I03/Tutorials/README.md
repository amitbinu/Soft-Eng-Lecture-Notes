### My Elevator Pitch

My name is Suhavi and I am a third year software engineering student at McMaster University. My research interests are data mining, machine learning, and blockchain technology and other cool stuff. I have experience in backend development using Java and Python as well as frontend experience using JavaScript and node js. I've also been to a lot of hackathons. My goal after graduation is to use my knowledge to build useful applications and solve real-life problems.
