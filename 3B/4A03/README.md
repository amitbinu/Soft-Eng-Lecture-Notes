### Vision for Course
- better understanding of how the worls is interconencted and have responsability for your actions
- clearer idea of how you choose to contribute personally and professionally

### Ethics and Morality in General
- Her Dilemma, Thomas Hardy - intro to ethics
    - dilemma: choice between 2 imperfect options
    - the gurl decided to lie and say she loves a guy who was dying, in a church
    - "De kind wenever possible. It is always possible" - Dalai Lam
- What is the right thing to do?
- **naive realism** - the idea that if someone is different belief than you then you believe theyre stupid, missing information or too lazy to come up with the same conclusion as you
- "Test of first-rate intelligance is the ability to hold 2 opposed idea in the mind and at the same time retain the ability to function" - Scott Fitzgerald

### Trolley Problems
- There is a runaway trolley headed down a track
- 5 people are tied to the track by some mad guy
- you can flip a switch to divert the train but the 1 person tied to other track
- in ethics there are 3 options
    - ethically obligatory to pull the switch
    - ethically forbidden to pull switch
    - ethically permissible (you could do it but don't have to)

#### Trolley and the Fat Man
- runaway trolley headed down a track, 5 people are ties to the track
- you're on a bridge and could drop a fat guy in front of the train to stop it and prevent 5 deaths
- this time you are directly causing a death so less people would push him

#### The Transplant
- You're a genius doctor and 5 of your patients need transplants
- unfortunately no organs are available
- a healthy traveller comes and he has all da organs
- assume that nobody will suspect you if you kill the traveler off

#### Why?
- it matters whether you're directly involved or indirectly
- in the first example the mad scientist puts lives in danger, not you
- platinum rule: all people are different
- does it matter if you know the people?
- does it matter how many people? is there a threshold?

#### Types of Ethics
- meta-ethics
    - how do we understand what's right and wrong?
- normative ethics
    - what should we do to be moral?
- descriptive ethics
    - by hat values do people actually abide by?
- moral psychology
    - how does moral capacity develop, how do we determine morals

#### Ethics Lanuage
- consequentialism - the morality of an action is to be judged on its consequences
- deontology - says the morality of an action is to be judged in and of the action itself
    - opposite of consequentialism
- stakeholders - who has something to gain or lose from this?
- utilitarianism - the greatest good for the greatest number of people
- moral involvement - degree to which someone is involved in moral dillema
- moral obigation - do you have any sort of duties/respondabilities to people
- values - a person's principles or stansards of behaviur, judgement of whats important in life
- intentinoal harm - acting with the will to hurt another. Measuring immorality of decision is a form of deontolgical ethics
- rights - moral legal entitlements
- categorical imperative - unconditional moral obligation

##### Things to Abide By
It's not blac and white always
