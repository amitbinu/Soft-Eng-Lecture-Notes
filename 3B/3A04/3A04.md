# 3A04 Software Design III 

## Day 1 Jan 5, 2018

- Fridays are for problem solving :relieved:

### Course Breakdown

1. Software requirements
  - Pre-reqs -> reqs -> Architecture design -> Coding -> Testing
2. Software architecture design space (types of software structures, software elements, sofware connectors)
3. Design Principles for sustainable systems
4. How to approach practical problems using architecture design

### Last Year Final Exam

5. Using appropriate design pricnciples, compare 2 designs in figure.
  Design A - interconnected, multi-directed, a lot of things depend on other things
  Design B - organized, singly directed, not a lot of interdependency
  
  Design B is better as it has low coupling high cohesion! :bowtie:
  
6. Build simple software that translates Fahrenheit to Celcius. Choose suitable architecture design.
    - not that hard :innocent:
    
8. AI system. Algorithm has uncertainty therefore we need specific architecture. What wil be the most suitable architecture?
  
9. Gives context for system, system to allow fire dept to follow fire situation in agricultural, forest, industrial areas. System will have sensors for each area.
    - choose appropriate software architecture
 
### Grading
 
- Project
  - teams of 4-5 (not chosen by us :cold_sweat:)
